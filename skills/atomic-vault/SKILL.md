# Atomic Vault Workflow

The vault is Atomic's built-in project-management and context system. It tracks
**intents** (units of work), **goals** (work sessions), and **memories**
(durable knowledge). Every unit of work is a **directive-based intent** that
must end **conforming and attested** — an intent with no `:::why` cannot be
validated or signed, so it is dead on arrival.

## Core Concepts

- **Intent** — a unit of work, authored as directives (`:::why`,
  `:::acceptance-criterion`, `:::task`, `:::scope-in`/`:::scope-out`,
  `:::constraint`). It has an ID (e.g. `PROJ::you::1`), a status, and lifts to a
  canonical node you `validate` and `attest`.
- **Goal** — a focused work session tying one or more intents together.
- **Memory** — a durable, attestable knowledge record of a chosen kind
  (`decision`, `lesson`, `constraint`, `preference`, `context`). See the
  `/decision-record` skill.

## Intent Commands

```bash
atomic intent list                                 # List intents + attested/verifies (CHECK FIRST)
atomic intent new "<title>"                        # Create a directive-based intent
atomic intent show <id>                            # Render the lifted intent
atomic intent validate <id>                        # Gate it against the canonical shapes
atomic intent attest <id>                          # Sign the conforming intent
atomic intent verify <id>                          # Verify a signed intent
atomic intent update <id> --status <status>        # Set status / fields
atomic intent delete <id>                          # Delete an unstarted backlog intent
atomic intent link <id> --goal <goal>              # Link the intent to a goal
```

Always create with `atomic intent new`. (The old `atomic vault intent create`
wrote a legacy template that did not lift — no `:::why`, so it could never
validate or attest — and has been removed.)

### Intent statuses

`backlog` → `planned` → `in-progress` → `review` → `done`

### CRITICAL: check before creating

Run `atomic intent list` first. Duplicate intents waste effort — only create a
new one if none covers the work.

## The intent file is directive-based

`atomic intent new` scaffolds `.vault/intents/<id>/intent.md` with stubs you
fill. Replace **every** stub. `:::why` is **mandatory** — the gate rejects an
intent with no `why` (its content isn't graded, but it must be present):

```markdown
:::why
Why this work matters — the reason it exists.
:::

:::acceptance-criterion{#<uid>-ac-1 status=unmet}
A single concrete, checkable outcome that means "done".
:::

:::task{#<uid>-1 status=unmet criteria=<uid>-ac-1}
An ordered work item toward the criterion above.
::file-ref{path=path/to/file}
:::

:::scope-in
What this intent will change.
:::

:::scope-out
What it will deliberately NOT change.
:::

:::constraint
A rule the implementation must respect.
:::
```

After editing the file, run `atomic vault sync` to persist to the vault
database. The CLI reads `show`/`validate`/`attest`/`update` from the database,
not the file — so sync **before** them, or `show` renders the stale scaffold and
`update` re-materializes the database copy over your edits, clobbering them.
(`atomic vault sync` is not `atomic record` — hooks handle recording; you still
run `sync`.)

## Goal Commands

```bash
atomic vault goal start "goal name"     # Start a new work session
atomic vault goal stop                  # Stop the current goal
atomic vault goal resume <name>         # Resume a suspended goal
atomic vault goal list                  # List all goals
```

### Goal Statuses

- **active** — Currently being worked on
- **suspended** — Paused (via `goal stop`), can be resumed
- **completed** — Finished

## Memory Commands

Memories are durable knowledge, authored and signed like intents:

```bash
atomic memory kinds                                        # Allowed kinds + when to use each
atomic memory new --kind <kind> --text "..." --derived-from <urn>   # Create (canonical)
atomic memory attest <id>                                  # Gate and sign
atomic memory validate <id>                                # Confirm it conforms once signed
atomic memory list [-n <N>]                                # List — recent first, full ULID, kind/status/attested
atomic memory show <id>                                    # Show a memory's content
atomic memory write <name> [--type <t>]                    # Freeform write from stdin (raw escape hatch)
```

Capture durable memories at turn end and classify each into the right kind —
see the `/decision-record` skill for the rubric and source-linking.

## Full Workflow (End to End)

Follow this sequence for every piece of work:

### 1. Check existing intents

```bash
atomic intent list
```

Look for an existing intent that matches the task. Do NOT create duplicates.

### 2. Create ONE intent (if needed)

```bash
atomic intent new "Implement user authentication"
```

One intent per unit of work. It prints the ID and the file path.

### 3. Fill the directives

Replace every stub in `.vault/intents/<id>/intent.md`: the mandatory `:::why`,
at least one `:::acceptance-criterion` and `:::task`, plus scope/constraints.
Then persist:

```bash
atomic vault sync
```

### 4. (Optional) Start a goal

```bash
atomic vault goal start "auth-implementation"
atomic intent link <id> --goal auth-implementation
```

### 5. Do the work

Write code and iterate. As each criterion's outcome holds, **verify** it (run
the actual checks), then flip its `status=unmet` → `status=met` in the intent
file with your **file-editing tool** (never bash, Python, or sed — that bypasses
the vault), and `atomic vault sync`. Do not mark a criterion met speculatively.

**Marking a criterion met takes three attributes, not one.** The gate rejects a
checked box with nothing behind it, so set `verifiedBy` and `evidence` in the
same edit:

```markdown
:::acceptance-criterion{#<uid>-ac-1 status=met verifiedBy="<who/what checked it>" evidence="<how it was checked>"}
```

`verifiedBy` names what did the checking (a DID, a test name, a person);
`evidence` records how (a command that passed, a change urn, an observation).
Flipping only `status=met` makes `atomic intent validate` fail with
`a met acceptance criterion must carry verifiedBy and evidence`.

You do **not** create or switch views, and you do **not** run `atomic add` or
`atomic record` — the integration's hooks own all of that:

- **Session start** forks a draft view from your current view and switches into
  it automatically. Your whole session runs inside it.
- **Turn end** records automatically — `status` → `add` → `record --all` with
  full AI provenance (model, tokens, cost, session, decision graph).
- **Session end** switches back to your original view.

To review what the hooks recorded, use the `/atomic-vcs` skill.

### 6. Validate, attest, and complete

An intent is not done until it **conforms and is signed**:

```bash
atomic vault sync                          # persist your edits first
atomic intent update <id> --status done    # mark it done
atomic vault sync
atomic intent validate <id>                # MUST conform
atomic intent attest <id>                  # sign the completed intent
```

`validate` is a hard gate: before `attest` the only violations it may report are
the fillable `attributedTo` + `proof` (which `attest` fills). If it flags `why`
or a criterion, your directives are incomplete — fix them, `atomic vault sync`,
and validate again. Confirm with `atomic intent list`: the intent must show
`fresh` / `✓`.

### 7. Stop the goal when done

```bash
atomic vault goal stop
atomic vault sync
```

## Resuming Work

If you stopped a goal and need to come back:

```bash
atomic vault goal list                  # Find the suspended goal
atomic vault goal resume "auth-implementation"
# Continue working — the hooks manage the session view for you
```

## Tips

- One intent per unit of work; run `atomic intent list` first.
- **`:::why` is mandatory** — no `why`, no attest. Create with `atomic intent
  new` (the legacy `atomic vault intent create` has been removed).
- Fill the directives before coding; `atomic vault sync` after every file edit
  and before every `show`/`validate`/`attest`/`update`.
- Finish with `validate` → `attest`; the intent isn't done until `atomic intent
  list` shows it `fresh` / `✓`.
- You don't manage views or recording — hooks fork a draft view at session
  start, record at turn end, and restore your view at session end. Inspect the
  results with the `/atomic-vcs` skill.
